<h2> #1: Green Tread's online store </h2>
<h3> Sep 2015- Jan 2016 </h3>
<p id="intro">
  • Project name: Tyre Buyers' Paradise <br>
  • Background: I joined the project through the university course "User Experience Design Project 1".<br>
  • Challenge: How can an Estonia-based tyre company attract sales in Finland? <br>
  • Role: Examinine the web store and find out ways it can be improved from UX point of view. <br>
  • Team: 1 UX designer, 2 marketers, 2 programmers. <br>
  • Result: First level license from the company. Graded 5/5. <br>
</p>

<h2 class="heading"> THE CHALLENGE </h2>
<p class="p_wrap">
Lehvid.com is an Estonia-based tyre web store that belongs to Green Tread Oy in Finland.
The purpose of the project was to improve the current web store in order to attract customers and increase sales via the web store.
My job as a UX designer in the team was to examine, evaluate, and design the current web store accordingly. <br>
</p>

<h2 class="heading"> THE PROCESS </h2>
<p class="p_wrap">
 The project kick-started in a meeting with the key stakeholders.
 The current web store was not attracting Finnish customers at all, and
 the company representative wanted to know the reason.<br>
 <br>
 We first defined the target customer group through discussion.
 Questions after questions led the team to define the target customer group as
 "Car owners in Finland, aged between 20 to 70". <br>
<br>
In defining the goals and directions, we found the major flaws of the current web store:
Technical insecurity, lack of usability, reliability, and consistency, which were all
damaging to building of the company's brand image through the web store.
Thorughout the iterations and workshops, the team kept the discussion alive on the
customers' desires and needs in varying context. <br>
<br>
The design decisions were made based on the following concepts: <br>
<br>
• Be simple: Finding tyres online are often complicated. By applying Trafi search function,
the experience of searching tyres online can be simpler and easier. <br>
• Bring a sense of trust: Give the user reason to shop in the online store.<br>
• Be approachable: Tyres can be hard to know. Make it easy for them to get the help they need.<br>

<h2> #2: UX Personas </h2>
<h3> Mar 2016- Apr 2016 </h3>
<p id="intro">
  • Project name: Scook's UX personas <br>
  • Challenge: How to create UX personas to design the product? <br>
  • Role: Designer. <br>
  <br>
</p>

<h2 class="heading"> THE BACKGROUND </h2>
<p class="p_wrap">
  The team project in the university course "Entrepreneurship in Knowledge Economy" consisted of
  developing a business idea, designing of a product/service, and analysis of global economy and product market, among others.
  Designing a product and functional side of the product required the need for UX thinking,
  and the UX personas were created as a by-product. The product as a mobile application was named "Scook", which serves busy students
  who would like to lead a healthier life style by cooking more often. <br>
