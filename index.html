<p class="intro">
  • Project name: Tyre Buyers' Paradise <br>
  • Background: I joined the project through a university course "User Experience Design Project 1."<br>
  • Challenge: How can an Estonia-based tyre company attract sales in Finland? <br>
  • Role: Examine the web store and find out ways it can be improved from UX point of view. <br>
  • Team: 1 UX designer, 2 marketers, 2 programmers. <br>
  • Result: First level license from the company. Graded 5/5. <br>
</p>

<h2 class="heading"> THE CHALLENGE </h2>
<p class="p_wrap">
Lehvid.com is Estonia-based tyre web store that belongs to Green Tread Oy in Finland.
The purpose of the project was to improve the web store in order to attract Finnish customers and increase sales.
My job as a UX designer was to examine, evaluate, and design the web store accordingly. <br>
</p>

<h2 class="heading"> THE PROCESS </h2>
<p class="p_wrap">
 The project kick-started in a meeting with the key stakeholders.
 The web store was attracting no Finnish customers despite the intention, and
 the company representative wanted to know why.<br>
 <br>
 We first defined the target customer group through discussion.
 Questions after questions led the team to define the target customer group as
 "Car owners in Finland, aged between 20 to 70". <br>
<br>
In defining the goals and directions, we found the major flaws of the current web store:
Technical insecurity, lack of usability, reliability, and consistency, which were all
damaging to building of the company's brand image through the web store.
<br>
<br>
The design decisions were made based on the following concepts: <br>
<br>
• Be simple: Finding tyres online are often complicated. By applying Trafi search function,
the experience of searching tyres online can be simpler and easier. <br>
• Bring a sense of trust: Give the user reason to shop in the online store.<br>
• Be approachable: Tyres can be hard to know. Make it easy for them to get the help they need.<br>
<br>
I created a few initial sketches of the web pages based on these concepts. The sketches received feedbacks
through workshops,and went through many iterations.
For communication, we used email and had regular meetings with both the team and the client.

<h2 class="title"> #2: UX Personas </h2>
<h3 class="date"> Mar 2016- Apr 2016 </h3>
<p class="intro">
  • Project name: Scook's UX personas <br>
  • Background: This project was done within the context of a university course project that wasn't meant to be a UX project.<br>
  • Challenge: How to create UX personas to design a product<br>
  • Role: Designer <br>
</p>

<h2 class="heading"> THE BACKGROUND </h2>
<p class="p_wrap">
  The team project in the university course "Entrepreneurship in Knowledge Economy" was about
  developing a business idea, designing of a product/service, and analyzing global economy and product market, among others.
  I decided that designing a product required the need for UX thinking,
  and so I turned it into a small UX project by creating UX personas. There was naturally a certain limit to developing the UX design of the product
  as the course project was not meant to be a UX project.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h2 class="heading"> THE PROCESS </h2>
<p class="p_wrap">
The imaginary product "Scook" is a mobile application that combines two ideas; recipe and health management. The app is meant to serve
busy students who wish to cook more often for a healthier life style.<br>
<br>
Learning about UX design on the go, I started the project by thinking about various aspects of an imaginary user of the product "Scook".
Deciding which aspects to include in the UX personas was challenging, and it wasn't clear which standards to apply to
select them. Nonetheless, the process of making the UX personas helped me to think through some of important questions in UX design,
such as the real purpose of UX persona, its implications, and the ways it can be used effectively. <br>
