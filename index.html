<h2> #1: Green Tread's online store </h2>
<h3> Sep 2015- Jan 2016 </h3>
<p id="intro">
  • Project name: Tyre Buyers' Paradise <br>
  • Background: I joined the project through the university course "User Experience Design Project 1".<br>
  • Challenge: How can an Estonia-based tyre company attract sales in Finland? <br>
  • Role: Examine the web store and find out ways it can be improved from UX point of view. <br>
  • Team: 1 UX designer, 2 marketers, 2 programmers. <br>
  • Result: First level license from the company. Graded 5/5. <br>
</p>

<h2 class="heading"> THE CHALLENGE </h2>
<p class="p_wrap">
Lehvid.com is an Estonia-based tyre web store that belongs to Green Tread Oy in Finland. <br>
The purpose of the project was to improve the current web store in order to attract customers and increase sales via the web store. <br>
My job as a UX designer in the team was to examine, evaluate, and design the current web store accordingly. <br>
</p>

<h2 class="heading"> THE PROCESS </h2>
<p class="p_wrap">
 The project kick-started in a meeting with the key stakeholders. <br>
 The current web store was not attracting Finnish customers at all, and <br>
 the company representative wanted to know the reason.<br>
 <br>
 We first defined the target customer group through discussion. <br>
 Questions after questions led the team to define the target customer group as <br>
 "Car owners in Finland, aged between 20 to 70". <br>
<br>
In defining the goals and directions, we found the major flaws of the current web store: <br>
Technical insecurity, lack of usability, reliability, and consistency, which were all <br>
damaging to building of the company's brand image through the web store. <br>
Thorughout the iterations and workshops, the team kept the discussion alive on the <br>
customers' desires and needs in varying context. <br>
<br>
The design decisions were made based on the following concepts: <br>
<br>
• Be simple: Finding tyres online are often complicated. By applying Trafi search function,<br>
the experience of searching tyres online can be simpler and easier. <br>
• Bring a sense of trust: Give the user reason to shop in the online store.<br>
• Be approachable: Tyres can be hard to know. Make it easy for them to get the help they need.<br>
